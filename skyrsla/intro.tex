	i intend to use materials kits from the V5 CLASSROOM SUPER KITS which has Contains that Includes all required parts such as 
	V5 System Bundle: this V5 System Bundle,
	This bundle includes everything i need to get started with V5, 
	and is engineered to provide the most advanced way of building the machine. 
	though it does not include any motors or structural parts.

	it contains the V5 Smart Motors: The V5 Smart Motor is more than twice as powerful as the 2-Wire motor 393, 
	and puts an integrated encoder and a motor controller into one compact package. 
	Customize speed and torque with interchangeable gear cartridges.it Uses the built-in encoder to track a robot's rotational position and velocity
	it Ships with the standard gear cartridge of 18:1 (200 RPM).
	Cartridges for 36:1 (100 RPM) & 6:1 (600 RPM) are also available. Compatible with both VEX EDR shaft sizes. and
	The motor runs at a slightly lower voltage than the batteries minimum voltage, and the motor's power is accurately controlled to +/-1%.
	This means the motor will perform the same for every match and every autonomous run regardless of battery charge or motor temperature.

	it also contains the Vision Sensor: this features Give the driver the chance to see things from the robot's perspective. 
	The Vision Sensor is capable of detecting up to 7 colors at once, including multi-colored objects. 
	Connect a phone or tablet to the V5 Robot Brain through built-in WiFi to stream a live feed of your robot's view to your device. and
	Other features include: Tracks up to seven individual colors at once, Analyze objects for advanced tracking and path planning, Built-in Wi-Fi radio,
	and Compatible with VEX IQ
 
	with all these and by the use of the C++ Professional Programming Language. i intend to build a machine as a

	Robot that picks up different coloured balls and sort them into seperate boxes (QR codes?)

	and also the Robot that creates pictures/shapes with differently coloured balls or perhaps cubes

	its is also going to be a robots that have live streaming videos and its is also going to be a machine or just a 
	Robot that follows lines

5.  robot that follows traffic laws like a car. Stops when sign is red, turns in direction of arrow, etc. Follows lines that are the roads. Can turn on controller.
    crash prevention (ultrasonic range finder). Can recognize shapes and colors. Course leads to object that it picks up and delivers onto a platform.
6.  Robot that stacks cubes in a specific order by color or creates 3d models with them.
7.  1 wheel robot that balances itself

8.  2 wheel robot that balances itself
9.  Robot that can go over hills. Could use a variety of different methods to do this. Can also go down (lines, color of hill, gyroscope).
10. Robot that can be controlled through the internet using a keyboard. Livestreams video.
11. Crane robot that can spin its body/arm.
